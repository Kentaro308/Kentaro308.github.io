# About Me
Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. student at Harvard Kennedy School (Ph.D. in Public Policy, Politics and Institutions Track).

I am working on political methodologies for political science research and their application. Methodologically, I am interested in how to improve the current methodological practice using unstructured multi-modal data (text, images, videos). I am substantively interested in political violence and political communication.

I have been engaged in several research projects related to these interests. My work has been published at the peer-reviewed journal (Journal of Conflict Resolution, International Journal of Communication).

Before coming at Harvard, I received M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago and B.A. in Political Science from Waseda University in Japan. Feel free to reach me out from knakamura [at]g.harvard.edu.
