Welcome to my website. I am a second-year master's Student at the Department of Statistics, University of Chicago. My interest spans two fields: international relations (especially, confict and terrorism) and political methodologies (especially, Causal Inference and Machine Learning). I am Data and Causal Inference Analyst at Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST) led by Professor Robert Pape. I received my B.A. in Political Science in September 2021 from Waseda University. I intend to graduate on June, 2023. You can download my CV from here
