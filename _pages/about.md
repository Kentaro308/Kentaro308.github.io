Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. student at Harvard Kennedy School (Ph.D. in Public Policy, Politics and Institutions Track).

My interest spans two fields: international relations (especially, political violence, civil wars, terrorism, and misinformation) and political methodologies (especially, causal inference, machine learning, and integration of both fields). Substantively, I am interested in the interaction among militant organizations, governments, and local populations and how militant organizations try to survive under severe counterinsurgencies. I am also investigating how information campaigns are carried out by states or non-state organizations, and how we can prevent it. To solve my research question, I am developing novel methodologies, working mainly on causal inference, machine learning, and their intersection.

I have been engaged in several research projects related to these interests. My work has been published at the peer-reviewed journal (international journal of communication). Since September 2022, I also have worked as a Data and Causal Inference Analyst at Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST).

Before coming at Harvard, I received M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago and B.A. in Political Science from Waseda University in Japan. You can download my CV from [here](https://k-nakam.github.io/files/CV.pdf). Feel free to reach me out from knakamura [at]g[dot]harvard[dot]edu.
