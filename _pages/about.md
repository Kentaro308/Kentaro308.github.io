# About Me
Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. student at Harvard Kennedy School (Politics and Institutions track).

My research centers on political methodologies and applications. Methodologically, I am interested in the intersection of causal inference and machine learning, especially causal inference methods for multi-modal data such as text, images, and videos. Substantively, my focus lies on political violence and political communication.

I have contributed to several research projects aligned with these interests, and my work has been published in peer-reviewed journals, including the Journal of Conflict Resolution and the International Journal of Communication.

Before joining Harvard, I earned an M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago and a B.A. in Political Science from Waseda University in Japan. Feel free to reach out to me at knakamura [at] g.harvard.edu.
