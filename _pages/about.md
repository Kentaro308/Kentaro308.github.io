Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. student in at Harvard Kennedy School (Ph.D. in Public Policy, Politics and Institutions Track). 

My interest spans two fields: international relations (especially, political violece, civil wars, terrorism, and international communication) and political methodologies (especially, causal inference, machine learning, and integration of both fields). I have been engaged in several research projects related to these interests. My work has been published at the peer-reviewed journal (international jounrnal of communication). Since September 2022, I also have worked as a Data and Causal Inference Analyst at Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST).

Before coming at Harvard, I received M.S. in Statictis from the University of Chicago and B.A. in Political Science from Waseda University in Japan. You can download my CV from [here](https://k-nakam.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
