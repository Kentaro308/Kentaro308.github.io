Welcome to my website. I am a second-year master's Student at the Department of Statistics, University of Chicago. From 2023 fall, I will join Harvard University as a Ph.D. student in Public Policy (Politics and Institution track, Harvard Kennedy School).

My interest spans two fields: international relations (especially, political violece, civil wars, terrorism, and international communication) and political methodologies (especially, causal inference, machine learning, and integration of both fields). I have been engaged in several research projects related to these interests. My work has been published at the peer-reviewed journal (international jounrnal of communication). Since September 2022, I also have worked as a Data and Causal Inference Analyst at Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST) led by Professor Robert Pape.

Before coming at the University of Chicago, I received my B.A. in Political Science in September 2021 from Waseda University in Japan. You can download my CV from [here](https://k-nakam.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
